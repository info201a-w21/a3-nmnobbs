# Assignment 3: Incarceration
In this assignment, you'll create the necessary files to perform the analysis described on Canvas (including `analysis.R`, `index.Rmd`, and by _knitting_ your document, an `index.html` file).

Once you have completed your report, make sure to **change your repository settings** so that you can view the hosted website (which will be available at https://ORGANIZATION_NAME.github.io/REPO_NAME)

**Introduction**
An introduction of the problem domain and a description of the variable(s) you are choosing to analyze (and why!)

**Summary**
A paragraph of summary information, citing at least 5 values calculated from the data

Introduction + Summary Information
As you introduce your report and the dataset, you should describe the variables that you've chosen to analyze. In doing so, make clear which measure(s) of incarceration you are focusing on.

Then, you will share at least 5 relevant values of interest. These will likely be calculated using your DPLYR skills, answering questions such as:

What is the average value of my variable across all the counties (in the current year)?
Where is my variable the highest / lowest?
How much has my variable change over the last N years?
